## üöÄ Getting Started

### Cloning the repository

To get started with EntertainHub, follow the steps below to clone the repository and set up the environment on your machine.

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ottosuhett/EntertainHub.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:

4. Setting up environment variables (API Keys)

This project uses the RAWG API to fetch game data. You will need your own API key to use EntertainHub's features. Follow these steps:

1. Create a .env.local file in the root directory of the project:

```bash
touch .env.local
```
2. Open the .env.local file and add your RAWG API key by replacing <YOUR_RAWG_API_KEY> with your key:

- **NEXT_PUBLIC_API_KEY=<YOUR_RAWG_API_KEY>**
- **JWT_SECRET=myVeryStrongSecretKey**
- **NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=<YOUR_SUPABASE_URL>**
- **NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_API_KEY=<YOUR_SUPABASE_API_KEY>**

The JWT_SECRET variable is also configurable and can be set to any secret key of your choice for JWT authentication.

Running the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```
or
